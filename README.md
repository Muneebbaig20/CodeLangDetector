# Code Language Detector and Lexer

This project is a **multi-language lexer** and **language detector** for popular programming languages including C, C++, Java, Python, and PHP. It tokenizes the given code based on its syntax and can also detect which programming language the code belongs to. The lexer categorizes the tokens into different types such as keywords, operators, identifiers, strings, numbers, comments, and punctuation.

## Features
- **Language Detection:** Detects the programming language of the input code (C, C++, Java, Python, or PHP).
- **Lexer:** Tokenizes the input code into a list of tokens, categorized by their type.
- **Support for Multiple Languages:** Includes support for C, C++, Python, Java, and PHP with their syntax rules and keywords.
- **Customizable:** Easily extendable to support more programming languages or update regex patterns.

## Supported Languages
- **C**
- **C++**
- **Python**
- **Java**
